# Hierarchical-Clustering

This Jupyter Notebook provides an analysis of customer segmentation using the Mall_Customers.csv dataset. The goal is to group customers based on their demographic and behavioral attributes, such as age, annual income, and spending score, using hierarchical clustering.

1. Introduction
This notebook demonstrates how to perform customer segmentation using hierarchical clustering. The dataset contains information about mall customers, including their CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income (k$), and Spending Score (1-100). The analysis aims to group customers into clusters based on their similarities in income and spending behavior.

2. Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 200 rows and 5 columns:

CustomerID: Unique ID for each customer.

Gender: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).

Age: Age of the customer.

Annual Income (k$): Annual income in thousands of dollars.

Spending Score (1-100): Spending score assigned by the mall (1-100).

3. Data Preprocessing
Handling Outliers: Outliers in the Annual Income (k$) column were identified and removed using a boxplot and the np.where function.

Feature Selection: Only the relevant features (Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100)) were used for clustering.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Boxplots: Visualized the distribution of Annual Income (k$), Spending Score (1-100), and Age to identify outliers and understand the data spread.

Scatterplot: Plotted Annual Income (k$) vs. Spending Score (1-100) to observe patterns and relationships between the two variables.

5. Hierarchical Clustering
Dendrogram: A dendrogram was created using the linkage function with the ward method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Agglomerative Clustering: Applied hierarchical clustering using AgglomerativeClustering from sklearn with n_clusters=5 for 2D clustering and n_clusters=3 for 3D clustering.

6. Visualization
2D Clustering: A scatterplot was used to visualize the clusters based on Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100).

3D Clustering: A 3D scatterplot was created using plotly.express to visualize clusters based on Age, Annual Income (k$), and Spending Score (1-100).

7. Conclusion
The analysis successfully grouped customers into distinct clusters based on their income and spending behavior.

The 2D clustering revealed 5 clusters, while the 3D clustering with the addition of Age resulted in 3 clusters.

These clusters can help the mall management tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

Future Work
Experiment with other clustering algorithms like K-Means or DBSCAN.

Incorporate additional features like Gender for more nuanced segmentation.

Perform cluster profiling to interpret the characteristics of each group.
